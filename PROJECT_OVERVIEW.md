# Project Overview

## What Was Created

This Docker Compose framework provides a complete solution for running Unsloth notebooks locally with configurable environments. Here's what's included:

### Core Files

1. **docker-compose.yml** - Main orchestration file that supports:
   - Official `unsloth/unsloth` Docker image (recommended)
   - Custom enhanced image (optional)
   - Multiple pre-configured profiles (llama, mistral, qwen, etc.)
   - GPU support and resource management
   - Volume mounts for persistent data

2. **Dockerfile** - Enhanced image based on official Unsloth image with:
   - Additional development tools (vim, htop, etc.)
   - Extra Python packages (wandb, tensorboard, plotting libraries)
   - Proper user permissions

3. **.env.template** - Environment configuration template with:
   - All configurable options documented
   - Sensible defaults
   - Official Unsloth Docker environment variables

### Configuration Files

4. **configs/** - Pre-configured environments for popular models:
   - `llama3-8b.env` - Llama 3 8B fine-tuning
   - `mistral-7b.env` - Mistral 7B fine-tuning  
   - `qwen2-7b.env` - Qwen 2 7B fine-tuning
   - `codellama-7b.env` - CodeLlama 7B fine-tuning

### Scripts

5. **scripts/launcher.sh** - Main management script with commands:
   - `start [config]` - Start environment with optional configuration
   - `stop` - Stop containers
   - `logs` - View container logs
   - `download` - Download popular notebooks
   - `build` - Build custom image
   - `clean` - Clean up containers and images
   - `list` - List available configurations

6. **scripts/start-jupyter.sh** - Jupyter enhancement script:
   - Environment setup and validation
   - GPU detection and reporting
   - Notebook auto-download from URLs
   - HuggingFace and Wandb token setup
   - Model pre-loading

7. **scripts/download-notebooks.sh** - Notebook downloader:
   - Downloads popular Unsloth example notebooks
   - Places them in organized directory structure

8. **setup.sh** - First-time setup script:
   - Dependency checking (Docker, NVIDIA)
   - Directory creation
   - Environment file setup with prompts
   - Basic configuration

### Documentation

9. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation:
   - Quick start guide
   - Architecture explanation
   - Configuration options
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

10. **QUICKSTART.md** - Minimal quick start guide:
    - Essential commands only
    - Common troubleshooting
    - Fast path to running environment

### Examples

11. **examples/** - Sample configuration files:
    - `.env.production` - Production deployment settings
    - `.env.development` - Development/experimentation settings
    - `.env.research` - Multi-user research lab settings

## Key Features

### üéØ Environment Variable-Based Configuration
- Easily switch between different models and configurations
- Pre-configured environments for popular models
- Support for auto-loading notebooks from URLs

### üê≥ Official Unsloth Docker Integration
- Uses the official `unsloth/unsloth` image as foundation
- Maintains compatibility with official documentation
- Optional enhanced image with additional tools

### üöÄ Multiple Usage Patterns
- One-command start with sensible defaults
- Pre-configured model-specific environments
- Custom configuration via environment variables
- Auto-download and start notebooks from URLs

### üîß Production-Ready Features
- Resource limits and GPU management
- SSH access support
- Health checks
- Persistent storage
- Security configurations

### üìö Comprehensive Automation
- Automated dependency checking
- Directory structure creation
- Script management
- Model and token setup
- Notebook downloading

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Start (Default)
```bash
./setup.sh          # One-time setup
./scripts/launcher.sh start    # Start with defaults
```

### Pattern 2: Model-Specific Environment
```bash
./scripts/launcher.sh start llama3-8b
```

### Pattern 3: Custom Configuration
```bash
cp examples/.env.production .env
# Edit .env as needed
./scripts/launcher.sh start
```

### Pattern 4: URL-Based Notebook Loading
```bash
export NOTEBOOK_URL=https://example.com/notebook.ipynb
export AUTO_START_NOTEBOOK=true
./scripts/launcher.sh start
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Flexibility** - Supports both official image and custom builds
2. **Scalability** - Easy to add new model configurations
3. **Maintainability** - Uses official Unsloth image as foundation
4. **Usability** - One-command deployment with smart defaults
5. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new scripts and configurations

This framework bridges the gap between the simplicity of the official Unsloth Docker image and the need for automated, configurable deployments in development and production environments.
